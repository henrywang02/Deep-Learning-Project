## Deep Learning Project: Delivery Delay Prediction

### Introduction

- This project was developed as part of my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences under the guidance of Lecturer Juha PeltomÃ¤ki and with the collaboration of my friend Hua Trung Hieu. The goal of this project is to solve a multi-label delivery delay prediction problem, a significant challenge in supply chain management. 
- Using a real-world logistics dataset from Kaggle, I developed a deep learning model to predict delivery arrival status to enhance operational efficiency and reduce delivery delays.

### Project Highlights

- Multi-label classification for predicting delivery delays.
- Real-world dataset with diverse logistics variables.
- Focus on optimizing supply chain operations for better efficiency.
- Evaluated model performance using industry-standard accuracy metrics.

### Technologies & Skills Utilized
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature selection, and normalization.
- Deep Learning: Implemented MLP and LSTM models for classification.
- Data Visualization: Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for insights.
- Hybrid Teamwork: Collaborative learning and research with peers.
- Presentation Skills: Demonstrated project findings in an academic setting.

### Model Performance Overview

- The project involved testing multiple deep learning architectures and tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal accuracy. Models were evaluated based on precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy.

### Future Enhancements

- Fine-tuning deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
- Exploring alternative architectures such as CNN-LSTM hybrids.
- Applying domain-specific optimizations for real-world logistics applications.

### Acknowledgments

- I would like to express my gratitude to Lecturer Juha PeltomÃ¤ki for his guidance and Hua Trung Hieu for his collaboration throughout this project.
